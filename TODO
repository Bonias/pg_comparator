* distribution
- use EXTENSION framework?
- integrate to pgxn?

* asynchronous queries
- could push statements from lists..

* BUGS
- source[12]: will not work with -T if driver is not standard, see driver()
- DBD::mysql::db mysql_async_result failed:
  Gathering async_query_in_flight results for the wrong handle
  at ./pg_comparator line 1264.
- under -T may not really stop on errors?
- under -T, should I lock shared variables before updating them?

* validation
- check with NULL in keys. id=? with NULL is not a good idea...
