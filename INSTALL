* PostgreSQL

With version 8.0 or better, simply use the pgxs GNU makefile provided:

	sh> make install

You must only ensure that the "pg_config" found in your path is the one
of the target postgresql server, and that development packages are installed.

Then load the needed extensions (casts, checksum functions, xor aggregate),
create the pgcmp extension:

	psql> CREATE EXTENSION pgcmp;

To uninstall, do:

	sh> make uninstall


* MySQL

You need "mysql_config" and the development packages.

	sh> make mysql_install

Then load the needed extensions (casts, checksum functions):

	sh> cat mysql_*.sql | mysql ...
        # under Ubuntu this requires appending "/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/* rm,"
        # to "/etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld" and restarting apparmor.

To uninstall, do:

   	sh> make mysql_uninstall


* SQLite

You need the sqlite3-dev package to compile extensions.

	sh> make sqlite_install

See "sqlite_checksum.sql" file for loading checksum functions and
an integer xor aggregate.

To uninstall, do:

   	sh> make sqlite_uninstall
