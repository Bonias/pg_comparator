Postgresql 8.0 or better, simply use the pgxs GNU makefile provided:

	sh> make install

You must only insure that the "pg_config" found in your path is the one
of the target postgresql server, and that development packages are installed.

If you are fed up, you can remove all installed files with:

	sh> make uninstall

For MySQL, you need "mysql_config" and the development packages.

	sh> make mysql_install
	sh> cat mysql_*.sql | mysql <your-database>

To uninstall, do:

   	sh> make mysql_uninstall
