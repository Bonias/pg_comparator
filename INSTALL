Postgresql 8.0 or better:

Simply use the pgxs makefile provided:

	sh> gmake install

You must only insure that the pg_config found in your path is the one
of the target postgresql server.


For prior versions:

look at the postgresql documentation for compiling manually the C files
into shared objects and for fixing the sql loading scripts.
